# PRODIGY_DS_03

Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
"Sample Dateset :- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing"

In this task, you'll build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data. The dataset you'll be using is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset contains information about a marketing campaign by a Portuguese banking institution, where the goal was to predict whether a client would subscribe to a term deposit.

Key Steps:
Data Acquisition:
Download the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Data Preprocessing:
Load the dataset and perform necessary preprocessing tasks such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Features include demographic information like age, job, marital status, and behavioral data like the number of contacts made during the campaign.

Model Building:
Build a decision tree classifier using libraries like scikit-learn.
Train the model on the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data.

Model Evaluation:
Assess the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualize the decision tree to understand the model's decision-making process.

Visualization:
Optionally, visualize the decision tree structure and feature importance to gain insights into which features contribute most to the prediction.

Tools:
Python Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Expected Output:
The output will include the trained decision tree classifier, evaluation metrics, and visualizations that help explain the model's behavior. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on the provided data.
